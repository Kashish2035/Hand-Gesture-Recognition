# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
A real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

It detects simple hand gestures and maps them to media control actions:

✋ Open Palm → Play/Pause

✊ Fist → Play/Pause

👍 Thumbs Up → Volume Up

👎 Thumbs Down → Volume Down

The system works with webcam input and uses PyAutoGUI to control media playback.
